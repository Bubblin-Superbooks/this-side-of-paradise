<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Amory said politely.</p><p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I'm not afraid of the dark, so I put on my slicker and rubber boots and came out. You see I was always afraid, before, to say I didn't believe in God&mdash;because the lightning might strike me&mdash;but here I am and it hasn't, of course, but the main point is that this time I wasn't any more afraid of it than I had been when I was a Christian Scientist, like I was last year. So now I know I'm a materialist and I was fraternizing with the hay when you came out and stood by the woods, scared to death.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
