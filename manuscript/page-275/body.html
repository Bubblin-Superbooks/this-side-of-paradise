This has given you time to think and you're casting off a lot of your old luggage about success and the superman and all. People like us can't adopt whole theories, as you did. If we can do the next thing, and have an hour a day to think in, we can accomplish marvels, but as far as any high-handed scheme of blind dominance is concerned&mdash;we'd just make asses of ourselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Monsignor, I can't do the next thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amory, between you and me, I have only just learned to do it myself. I can do the one hundred things beyond the next thing, but I stub my toe on that, just as you stubbed your toe on mathematics this fall.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
