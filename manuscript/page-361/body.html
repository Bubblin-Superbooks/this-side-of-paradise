Monsignor took him several times to see Thornton Hancock, and once or twice to the house of a Mrs. Lawrence, a type of Rome-haunting American whom Amory liked immediately.</p><p>Then one day came a letter from Monsignor, which appended an interesting P. S.:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;that your third cousin, Clara Page, widowed six months and very poor, is living in Philadelphia? I don't think you've ever met her, but I wish, as a favor to me, you'd go to see her. To my mind, she's rather a remarkable woman, and just about your age.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
