That was all; for at the second that his decision came, he looked up and saw, ten yards from him, the man who had been in the cafe, and with his jump of astonishment the glass fell from his uplifted hand. There the man half sat, half leaned against a pile of pillows on the corner divan. His face was cast in the same yellow wax as in the cafe, neither the dull, pasty color of a dead man&mdash;rather a sort of virile pallor&mdash;nor unhealthy, you'd have called it; but like a strong man who'd worked in a mine or done night shifts in a damp climate.</p></div> </div>
