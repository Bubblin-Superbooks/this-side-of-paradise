<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This was the last night Amory ever saw Eleanor. He was leaving in the morning and they had agreed to take a long farewell trot by the cold moonlight. She wanted to talk, she said&mdash;perhaps the last time in her life that she could be rational (she meant pose with comfort). So they had turned into the woods and rode for half an hour with scarcely a word, except when she whispered &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; at a bothersome branch&mdash;whispered it as no other girl was ever able to whisper it. Then they started up Harper's Hill, walking their tired horses.</p><p>&ldquo;Good Lord! It's quiet here!&rdquo; whispered Eleanor; &ldquo;much more lonesome than the woods.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
