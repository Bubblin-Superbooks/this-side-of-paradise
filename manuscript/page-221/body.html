<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I want to go where people aren't barred because of the color of their neckties and the roll of their coats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can't, Tom,&rdquo; argued Amory, as they rolled along through the scattering night; &ldquo;wherever you go now you'll always unconsciously apply these standards of 'having it' or 'lacking it.' For better or worse we've stamped you; you're a Princeton type!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; complained Tom, his cracked voice rising plaintively, &ldquo;why do I have to come back at all? I've learned all that Princeton has to offer. Two years more of mere pedantry and lying around a club aren't going to help. They're just going to disorganize me, conventionalize me completely. Even now I'm so spineless that I wonder how I get away with it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
