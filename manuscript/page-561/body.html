He's just groggy with advertising. And&mdash;oh Harold Bell Wright oh Zane Grey&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They try.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, they don't even try. Some of them can write, but they won't sit down and do one honest novel. Most of them can't write, I'll admit. I believe Rupert Hughes tries to give a real, comprehensive picture of American life, but his style and perspective are barbarous. Ernest Poole and Dorothy Canfield try but they're hindered by their absolute lack of any sense of humor; but at least they crowd their work instead of spreading it thin. Every author ought to write every book as if he were going to be beheaded the day he finished it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
