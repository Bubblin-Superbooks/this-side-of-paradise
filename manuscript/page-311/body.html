Amory fancied he looked rather relieved on seeing him.</p><p>&ldquo;Had a hell of a dream about you last night,&rdquo; came in the cracked voice through the cigar smoke. &ldquo;I had an idea you were in some trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don't tell me about it!&rdquo; Amory almost shrieked. &ldquo;Don't say a word; I'm tired and pepped out.&rdquo;</p><p>Tom looked at him queerly and then sank into a chair and opened his Italian note-book. Amory threw his coat and hat on the floor, loosened his collar, and took a Wells novel at random from the shelf. &ldquo;Wells is sane,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and if he won't do I'll read Rupert Brooke.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
