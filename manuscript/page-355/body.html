I can always outguess a ghost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it depends where. Take a bedroom, for example. If you use any discretion a ghost can never get you in a bedroom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, s'pose you think there's maybe a ghost in your bedroom&mdash;what measures do you take on getting home at night?&rdquo; demanded Amory, interested.</p><p>&ldquo;Take a stick&rdquo; answered Alec, with ponderous reverence, &ldquo;one about the length of a broom-handle. Now, the first thing to do is to get the room cleared&mdash;to do this you rush with your eyes closed into your study and turn on the lights&mdash;next, approaching the closet, carefully run the stick in the door three or four times. Then, if nothing happens, you can look in. Always, always run the stick in viciously first&mdash;never look first!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
