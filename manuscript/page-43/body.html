Casey-Jones&mdash;mounted to the cab-un Took his farewell journey to the prom-ised land.&rdquo;</p><p>SNAPSHOTS OF THE YOUNG EGOTIST</p><p>Amory spent nearly two years in Minneapolis. The first winter he wore moccasins that were born yellow, but after many applications of oil and dirt assumed their mature color, a dirty, greenish brown; he wore a gray plaid mackinaw coat, and a red toboggan cap. His dog, Count Del Monte, ate the red cap, so his uncle gave him a gray one that pulled down over his face. The trouble with this one was that you breathed into it and your breath froze; one day the darn thing froze his cheek. He rubbed snow on his cheek, but it turned bluish-black just the same.</p></div> </div>
