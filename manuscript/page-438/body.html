You want life to be a chain of flirtation with a man for every link.</p><p>ROSALIND: Want it to be one! You mean I've found it one.</p><p>CECELIA: Ha!</p><p>ROSALIND: Cecelia, darling, you don't know what a trial it is to be&mdash;like me. I've got to keep my face like steel in the street to keep men from winking at me. If I laugh hard from a front row in the theatre, the comedian plays to me for the rest of the evening. If I drop my voice, my eyes, my handkerchief at a dance, my partner calls me up on the 'phone every day for a week.</p></div> </div>
