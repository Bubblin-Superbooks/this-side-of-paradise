Connage, Sloane, Humbird, Ferrenby, and Blaine.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl bobbed courtesies all around. Poor creature; Amory supposed she had never before been noticed in her life&mdash;possibly she was half-witted. While she accompanied them (Kerry had invited her to supper) she said nothing which could discountenance such a belief.</p><p>&ldquo;She prefers her native dishes,&rdquo; said Alec gravely to the waiter, &ldquo;but any coarse food will do.&rdquo;</p><p>All through supper he addressed her in the most respectful language, while Kerry made idiotic love to her on the other side, and she giggled and grinned. Amory was content to sit and watch the by-play, thinking what a light touch Kerry had, and how he could transform the barest incident into a thing of curve and contour. They all seemed to have the spirit of it more or less, and it was a relaxation to be with them.</p></div> </div>
