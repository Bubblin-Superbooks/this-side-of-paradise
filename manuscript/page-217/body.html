<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It'll be fine, I think, and I want to bring you just at the end of a wonderful year. I often think over what you said on that night and wonder how much you meant. If it were anyone but you&mdash;but you see I thought you were fickle the first time I saw you and you are so popular and everthing that I can't imagine you really liking me best. Oh, Isabelle, dear&mdash;it's a wonderful night. Somebody is playing &ldquo;Love Moon&rdquo; on a mandolin far across the campus, and the music seems to bring you into the window. Now he's playing &ldquo;Good-by, Boys, I'm Through,&rdquo; and how well it suits me. For I am through with everything. I have decided never to take a cocktail again, and I know I'll never again fall in love&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;you've been too much a part of my days and nights to ever let me think of another girl. I meet them all the time and they don't interest me.</p></div> </div>
