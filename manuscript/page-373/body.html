Am I painfully conceited?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no, you have tremendous vanity, but it'll amuse the people who notice its preponderance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You're really humble at heart.

For instance, you're always saying that you are a slave to high-balls.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
