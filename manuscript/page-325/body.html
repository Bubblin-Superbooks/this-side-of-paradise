How about you, Tom?&rdquo;</p><p>Tom nodded sheepishly.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Burne, &ldquo;you may strike a few poems that are tiresome, but I mean the mass of his work. He's tremendous&mdash;like Tolstoi. They both look things in the face, and, somehow, different as they are, stand for somewhat the same things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have me stumped, Burne,&rdquo; Amory admitted. &ldquo;I've read 'Anna Karenina' and the 'Kreutzer Sonata' of course, but Tolstoi is mostly in the original Russian as far as I'm concerned.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
