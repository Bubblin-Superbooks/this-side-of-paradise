<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Fine! I swear I think it'll be most entertaining. How do they feel up at Cap and Gown?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wild, of course. Every one's been sitting and arguing and swearing and getting mad and getting sentimental and getting brutal. It's the same at all the clubs; I've been the rounds. They get one of the radicals in the corner and fire questions at him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do the radicals stand up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, moderately well. Burne's a damn good talker, and so obviously sincere that you can't get anywhere with him. It's so evident that resigning from his club means so much more to him than preventing it does to us that I felt futile when I argued; finally took a position that was brilliantly neutral. In fact, I believe Burne thought for a while that he'd converted me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
