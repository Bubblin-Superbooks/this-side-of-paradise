<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The primary feature of edition 11 is restoration of em-dashes which are missing from edition 10. (My favorite instance is &ldquo;I won't belong&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I won't be&mdash;long&rdquo;.)</p><p>Characters which are 8-bit in the printed text were misrepresented in edition 10. Edition 10 had some end-of-paragraph problems. A handful of other minor errors are corrected.</p><p>Two volumes served as reference for edition 11: a 1960 reprint, and an undated reprint produced sometime after 1948. There are a number of differences between the volumes. Evidence suggests that the 1960 reprint has been somewhat &ldquo;modernized&rdquo;, and that the undated reprint is a better match for the original 1920 printing. Therefore, when the volumes differ, edition 11 more closely follows the undated reprint.</p></div> </div>
