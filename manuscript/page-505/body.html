<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>AMORY: Are you going to marry Dawson Ryder?</p><p>ROSALIND: Oh, don't ask me. You know I'm old in some ways&mdash;in others&mdash;well, I'm just a little girl. I like sunshine and pretty things and cheerfulness&mdash;and I dread responsibility. I don't want to think about pots and kitchens and brooms. I want to worry whether my legs will get slick and brown when I swim in the summer.</p><p>AMORY: And you love me.</p><p>ROSALIND: That's just why it has to end. Drifting hurts too much. We can't have any more scenes like this.</p></div> </div>
