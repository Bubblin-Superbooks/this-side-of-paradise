Then he walked up to the desk and deposited a page torn out of his note-book.</p><p>&ldquo;Here's a poem to the Victorians, sir,&rdquo; he said coldly.</p><p>The professor picked it up curiously while Amory backed rapidly through the door.</p><p>Here is what he had written:</p><p>&ldquo;Songs in the time of order You left for us to sing, Proofs with excluded middles, Answers to life in rhyme, Keys of the prison warder And ancient bells to ring, Time was the end of riddles, We were the end of time... Here were domestic oceans And a sky that we might reach, Guns and a guarded border, Gantlets&mdash;but not to fling, Thousands of old emotions And a platitude for each, Songs in the time of order&mdash; And tongues, that we might sing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
