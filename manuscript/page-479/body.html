Everywhere these countless lights, this promise of a night of streets and singing&mdash;he moved in a half-dream through the crowd as if expecting to meet Rosalind hurrying toward him with eager feet from every corner....

Even his dreams now were faint violins drifting like summer sounds upon the summer air.</p></div> </div>
