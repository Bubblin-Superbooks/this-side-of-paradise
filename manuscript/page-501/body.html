There was a poem I read somewhere&mdash;you'll say Ella Wheeler Wilcox and laugh&mdash;but listen:</p><p>&ldquo;For this is wisdom&mdash;to love and live, To take what fate or the gods may give, To ask no question, to make no prayer, To kiss the lips and caress the hair, Speed passion's ebb as we greet its flow, To have and to hold, and, in time&mdash;let go.&rdquo;</p><p>AMORY: But we haven't had.</p><p>ROSALIND: Amory, I'm yours&mdash;you know it. There have been times in the last month I'd have been completely yours if you'd said so. But I can't marry you and ruin both our lives.</p></div> </div>
