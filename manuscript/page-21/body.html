He had tutored occasionally&mdash;the idea being that he was to &ldquo;keep up,&rdquo; at each place &ldquo;taking up the work where he left off,&rdquo; yet as no tutor ever found the place he left off, his mind was still in very good shape. What a few more years of this life would have made of him is problematical. However, four hours out from land, Italy bound, with Beatrice, his appendix burst, probably from too many meals in bed, and after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America, to the amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around and returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier. You will admit that if it was not life it was magnificent.</p></div> </div>
