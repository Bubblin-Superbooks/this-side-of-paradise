I may not come back next year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you're only twenty! Give up college?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, Amory, you were saying a minute ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Amory interrupted, &ldquo;but I was just wishing. I wouldn't think of leaving college. It's just that I feel so sad these wonderful nights. I sort of feel they're never coming again, and I'm not really getting all I could out of them. I wish my girl lived here. But marry&mdash;not a chance. Especially as father says the money isn't forthcoming as it used to be.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
