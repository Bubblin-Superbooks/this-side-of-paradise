<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I hate woods,&rdquo; Amory said, shuddering. &ldquo;Any kind of foliage or underbrush at night. Out here it's so broad and easy on the spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The long slope of a long hill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the cold moon rolling moonlight down it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And thee and me, last and most important.&rdquo;</p><p>It was quiet that night&mdash;the straight road they followed up to the edge of the cliff knew few footsteps at any time. Only an occasional negro cabin, silver-gray in the rock-ribbed moonlight, broke the long line of bare ground; behind lay the black edge of the woods like a dark frosting on white cake, and ahead the sharp, high horizon. It was much colder&mdash;so cold that it settled on them and drove all the warm nights from their minds.</p></div> </div>
