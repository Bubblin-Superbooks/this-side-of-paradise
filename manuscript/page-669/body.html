<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Q.&mdash;Is that a bad sign in itself?</p><p>A.&mdash;Not necessarily.</p><p>Q.&mdash;What would be the test of corruption?</p><p>A.&mdash;Becoming really insincere&mdash;calling myself &ldquo;not such a bad fellow,&rdquo; thinking I regretted my lost youth when I only envy the delights of losing it. Youth is like having a big plate of candy. Sentimentalists think they want to be in the pure, simple state they were in before they ate the candy. They don't. They just want the fun of eating it all over again. The matron doesn't want to repeat her girlhood&mdash;she wants to repeat her honeymoon. I don't want to repeat my innocence. I want the pleasure of losing it again.</p></div> </div>
