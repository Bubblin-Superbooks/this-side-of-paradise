<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;THE BIG MAN&rdquo; 1. Inclined to stupidity and unconscious of social values. 2. Thinks dress is superficial, and is inclined to be careless about it. 3. Goes out for everything from a sense of duty. 4. Gets to college and has a problematical future. Feels lost without his circle, and always says that school days were happiest, after all. Goes back to school and makes speeches about what St. Regis's boys are doing. 5. Hair not slicked.</p><p>Amory had decided definitely on Princeton, even though he would be the only boy entering that year from St. Regis'. Yale had a romance and glamour from the tales of Minneapolis, and St. Regis' men who had been &ldquo;tapped for Skull and Bones,&rdquo; but Princeton drew him most, with its atmosphere of bright colors and its alluring reputation as the pleasantest country club in America.</p></div> </div>
