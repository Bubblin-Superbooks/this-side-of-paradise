<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, far down the shadowy line of University Place a white-clad phalanx broke the gloom, and marching figures, white-shirted, white-trousered, swung rhythmically up the street, with linked arms and heads thrown back:</p><p>&ldquo;Going back&mdash;going back, Going&mdash;back&mdash;to&mdash;Nas-sau&mdash;Hall, Going back&mdash;going back&mdash; To the&mdash;Best&mdash;Old&mdash;Place&mdash;of&mdash;All.

The song soared so high that all dropped out except the tenors, who bore the melody triumphantly past the danger-point and relinquished it to the fantastic chorus. Then Amory opened his eyes, half afraid that sight would spoil the rich illusion of harmony.</p></div> </div>
