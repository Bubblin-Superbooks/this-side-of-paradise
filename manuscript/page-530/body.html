We haven't seen you for several days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Amory. &ldquo;I'm quitting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;this is&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don't like it here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm sorry. I thought our relations had been quite&mdash;ah&mdash;pleasant. You seemed to be a hard worker&mdash;a little inclined perhaps to write fancy copy&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I just got tired of it,&rdquo; interrupted Amory rudely. &ldquo;It didn't matter a damn to me whether Harebell's flour was any better than any one else's. In fact, I never ate any of it. So I got tired of telling people about it&mdash;oh, I know I've been drinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
