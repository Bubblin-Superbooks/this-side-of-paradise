He was mildly surprised not to hear the shrill squawk of conversation from the next room, and he decided it must be quite formal. He approved of that&mdash;as he approved of the butler.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Myra,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>To his surprise the butler grinned horribly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;she's here.&rdquo; He was unaware that his failure to be cockney was ruining his standing. Amory considered him coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the butler, his voice rising unnecessarily, &ldquo;she's the only one what is here. The party's gone.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
