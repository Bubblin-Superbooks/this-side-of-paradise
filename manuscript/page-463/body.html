I had an idea that after a girl was kissed she was&mdash;was&mdash;won.</p><p>ROSALIND: Those days are over. I have to be won all over again every time you see me.</p><p>GILLESPIE: Are you serious?</p><p>ROSALIND: About as usual. There used to be two kinds of kisses: First when girls were kissed and deserted; second, when they were engaged. Now there's a third kind, where the man is kissed and deserted. If Mr. Jones of the nineties bragged he'd kissed a girl, every one knew he was through with her.</p></div> </div>
