He began directly, and so did Froggy:</p><p>&ldquo;I've heard a lot about you since you wore braids&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wasn't it funny this afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Both stopped. Isabelle turned to Amory shyly. Her face was always enough answer for any one, but she decided to speak.</p><p>&ldquo;How&mdash;from whom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From everybody&mdash;for all the years since you've been away.&rdquo; She blushed appropriately. On her right Froggy was hors de combat already, although he hadn't quite realized it.</p></div> </div>
