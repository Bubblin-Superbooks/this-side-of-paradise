<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why do we have to do the next thing? It never seems the sort of thing I should do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have to do it because we're not personalities, but personages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's a good line&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A personality is what you thought you were, what this Kerry and Sloane you tell me of evidently are. Personality is a physical matter almost entirely; it lowers the people it acts on&mdash;I've seen it vanish in a long sickness. But while a personality is active, it overrides 'the next thing.' Now a personage, on the other hand, gathers. He is never thought of apart from what he's done. He's a bar on which a thousand things have been hung&mdash;glittering things sometimes, as ours are; but he uses those things with a cold mentality back of them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
