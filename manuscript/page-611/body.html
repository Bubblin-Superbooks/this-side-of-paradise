Have you ever been feverish and had all noises divide into 'tump-tump-tump' until you could swear eternity was divisible into so many tumps? That's the way I feel&mdash;old horses go tump-tump....

Human beings can't go 'tump-tump-tump' without going crazy.&rdquo;</p><p>The breeze freshened and Eleanor pulled her cape around her and shivered.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you very cold?&rdquo; asked Amory.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I'm thinking about myself&mdash;my black old inside self, the real one, with the fundamental honesty that keeps me from being absolutely wicked by making me realize my own sins.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
