I've always suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous. Clothilde is having your breakfast brought up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am feeling very old to-day, Amory,&rdquo; she would sigh, her face a rare cameo of pathos, her voice exquisitely modulated, her hands as facile as Bernhardt's. &ldquo;My nerves are on edge&mdash;on edge.
