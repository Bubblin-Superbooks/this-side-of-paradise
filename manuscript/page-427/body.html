<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, we are getting warm. This is Alec's mother, Mrs. Connage, ample, dignified, rouged to the dowager point and quite worn out. Her lips move significantly as she looks for IT. Her search is less thorough than the maid's but there is a touch of fury in it, that quite makes up for its sketchiness. She stumbles on the tulle and her &ldquo;damn&rdquo; is quite audible. She retires, empty-handed.</p><p>More chatter outside and a girl's voice, a very spoiled voice, says: &ldquo;Of all the stupid people&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause a third seeker enters, not she of the spoiled voice, but a younger edition. This is Cecelia Connage, sixteen, pretty, shrewd, and constitutionally good-humored. She is dressed for the evening in a gown the obvious simplicity of which probably bores her. She goes to the nearest pile, selects a small pink garment and holds it up appraisingly.</p></div> </div>
